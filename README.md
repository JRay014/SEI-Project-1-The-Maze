# SEI-Project-1-The-Maze
A simple maze game.

Description & Approach

The game is designed to let the user see the maze once and then find their way through. A maze tameplate will be generated at random when the page loads and when the player enters
the maze a fog decends so the player can't see the whole maze. The player wins when they reach the winning square. The game then resets and a new random template is selected.
