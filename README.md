# SEI-Project-1-The-Maze
A simple maze game.

Description & Approach

The game is designed so that the player can select one of the stages to play through. When a stage is load it is originally hidden until the player enters it. 
Once the stage is generated the player can use WASD to move around. Walls and borders have collision and cannot be passed through. The player wins once they have
gotten to the star/cheese at the end of the maze.

Technologies

This game is built mostly in canvas. It's core mechanics involve key movement for the player and collision on walls and the win square. 

User Stories

- Users can select a maze from the starting list.
- Users choose to enter the maze selected through the "enter maze" button.
- Users can use WASD to move around the maze in up, left, down, and right respectively.
- Users can reset the maze at any time with the "reset" button.

Upcoming Features

Soon the game will have more levels built on bigger grids so that they are harder and more complex. There will be a level selector page that the game starts on 
so the player can choose which level they want to play. There will also be styling and win condition updates that will change the appearance and bring players back
to level select when they win.
